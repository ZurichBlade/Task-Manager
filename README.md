# Android Wear Task Manager
This is a task management app tailored for Android Wear devices. It allows users to add, view, and receive notifications for tasks. Tasks are stored persistently using Shared Preferences. The app features a user-friendly interface optimized for different watch shapes and utilizes a WearableRecyclerView for task listing. Notifications alert users about tasks due within the next hour, providing Task ID and Task Name for quick identification. Users can take action on notifications to access a screen displaying upcoming tasks for effective management.
